We regularly send hygiene and PPE shipments to our European partners who continue to work to protect people in crowded refugee camps. Because COVID-19 affects everybody, our response grew as the virus spread. We now also collaborate with multiple grassroots networks in the US to support their response.",

      'Distribute Aid was officially invited to join Operation <span class="italic">Allies</span> Welcome at Fort Pickett in November. Our role on base is to manage all the donated aid. We work with NGOs and departments across the base to assess the needs of our guests, and work with the community of external organizations supporting the Operation Allies Welcome mission to help facilitate aid deliveries. Once aid arrives on base we work with the US Marines to distribute items to guests, and supply materials for NGOs running education & activity programs to use in their classes. In November & December, our efforts resulted in more than 750,000 items being distributed to or used by 7,500 guests at Fort Pickett. You can support our work by <a href="https://opencollective.com/distribute-aid-usa/projects/fort-pickett?slug=fort-pickett" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-primary font-bold underline cursor-pointer">donating to us through our Open Collective page!</a>',
